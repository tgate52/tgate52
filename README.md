## 💡 About Me

Coming from a GitLab-based school environment, I’ve been transitioning to GitHub and modern DevOps tooling.  
Building pipelines, debugging workflows, and deploying containers has taught me far more than textbooks ever could.

I'm focused on learning by doing — and turning each project into one step closer to the engineer I’m becoming.
